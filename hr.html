			<h1>Sloth: Human Relations</h1>
		</header>

			<p>The majority of recorded sloth deaths in Costa Rica are due to contact with electrical lines and poachers. Their claws also provide another, unexpected deterrent to human hunters; when hanging upside-down in a tree, they are held in place by the claws themselves and often do not fall down even if shot from below.</p>

			<p>Sloths are victims of animal trafficking where they are sold as pets. However they make very poor pets as they have such a specialized ecology.</p>

			<p>The founder and director of the Green Heritage Fund Suriname, Monique Pool, has helped rescue and release more than 600 sloths, anteaters, armadillos, and porcupines.</p>

			<p>The Sloth Institute Costa Rica is known for caring, rehabilitating and releasing sloths back into the wild. Also in Costa Rica, the Aviarios Sloth Sanctuary cares for sloths. It rehabilitated and released about 130 individuals back into the wild. However, a report in May 2016 featured two former veterinarians from the facility who were intensely critical of the sanctuary's efforts, accusing it of mistreating the animals.</p>

			<p>The first of the Ice Age movies in 2002 features Sid, a prehistoric ground sloth, as a central character.</p>
