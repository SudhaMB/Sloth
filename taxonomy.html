			<h1>Sloth: Taxonomy and evolution</h1>
		</header>
		<main role="main">
			<p>Sloths belong to the superorder Xenarthra, a group of placental mammals believed to have evolved in the continent of South America around 60 million years ago.[6] One study found that xenarthrans broke off from other placental mammals around 100 million years ago.</p>

			<p>Anteaters and armadillos are also included among Xenarthra. The earliest xenarthrans were arboreal herbivores with sturdy vertebral columns, fused pelvises, stubby teeth, and small brains. Sloths are in the taxonomic suborder Folivora[2] of the order Pilosa. These names are from the Latin "leaf eater" and "hairy", respectively. Pilosa is one of the smallest of the orders of the mammal class; its only other suborder contains the anteaters.</p>

			<p>The Folivora is divided into five families, three of which are entirely extinct, while living species are spread across two families as follows:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Three-toed sloth, which contains four extant species
						<ul>
							  <li>The most common is the brown-throated sloth which inhabits the neotropical ecozone in the forests of South and Central America.</li>
							  <li>The pale-throated sloth, which inhabits tropical rainforests in northern South America. It is similar in appearance to, and often confused with, the brown-throated sloth, which has a much wider distribution. Genetic evidence indicates the two species diverged around 6 million years ago.</li>
							  <li>The maned sloth now found only in the Atlantic Forest of southeastern Brazil.</li>
								<li>The critically endangered pygmy three-toed sloth which is endemic to the small island of Isla Escudo de Veraguas off the coast of Panama.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				 <li>Megalonychidae, contains the extinct genus Megalonyx, and the two-toed sloth genus, in which there are two existing species:
					 <ul>
						 <li>Linnaeus's two-toed sloth found in Venezuela, The Guianas, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Brazil north of the Amazon River.</li>
						 <li>Hoffmann's two-toed sloth which inhabits tropical forests. It has two separate ranges, split by the Andes. One population is found from eastern Honduras[10] in the north to western Ecuador in the south, and the other in eastern Peru, western Brazil, and northern Bolivia.</li>
					 </ul>
				</li>
			</ul>


		<h3>Evolution</h3>
			<p>The common ancestor of the two existing sloth genera dates to about 40 million years ago, with similarities between the two- and three- toed sloths an example of convergent evolution.</p>

			<p>The ancient Xenarthra included a much greater variety of species than today. Ancient sloths were not arboreal but dwelled on land, and were the size of bears. The Megatherium, a widespread species was larger than an elephant.</p>

			<p>It is thought that swimming led to oceanic dispersal of Pilosans of the Caribbean to the Antilles by the Oligocene, and that the megalonychid Pliometanastes and the mylodontid Thinobadistes were able to colonise North America about 9 million years ago, well before the existence of the Isthmus of Panama. Additionally, the nothrotheriid Thalassocnus of the west coast of South America became adapted to a semiaquatic marine lifestyle.</p>

			<p>In Peru and Chile, sloths of the genus Thalassocnus adapted to a coastal marine lifestyle beginning in the late Miocene. Initially they just stood in the water, but over a span of four million years they eventually evolved into swimming creatures.</p>

			<h3>Extinctions</h3>
			<p>The three extinct families are:
				<details>
					<summary><i class="family">Megatheriidae</i></summary>
					<p>Ground sloths that existed for about 23 million years and went extinct about 11,000 years ago.</p>
				</details>
				<details>
					<summary><i class="family">Mylodontidae</i></summary>
					<p>Ground sloths that existed for about 23 million years and went extinct about 11,000 years ago.</p>
				</details>
				<details>
					<summary><i class="family">Nothrotheriidae</i></summary>
					<p>Ground sloths that lived from approximately 11.6 million to 11,000 years ago. As well as ground sloths this family included Thalassocnus, a genus of semi- or fully aquatic sloth.</p>
				</details>
				<br/>
			<p>Ground sloths lived in South America and, after the Great American Interchange, North America. They disappeared shortly after the appearance of humans about 11,000 years ago. Evidence suggests human hunting contributed to the extinction of the American megafauna. Ground sloth remains found in both North and South America indicate that they were killed, cooked, and eaten by humans.[4] Climate change that came with the end of the last ice age may have also played a role. Megalocnus survived on the Antilles until about 5000 years ago, long after other ground sloths died out on the mainland, but then went extinct when humans finally arrived there too.</p>
